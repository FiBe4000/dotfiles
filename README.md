# dotfiles
My dotfiles and other configuration files for my Arch Linux system on my ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 6 and my desktop.

## Installation
Run the setup script. Sudo may be needed to create some of the symlinks. WARNING: old config files will be overwritten by the script as of now, however the script will ask for confirmation before creating the symlinks.
