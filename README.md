# dotfiles
My dotfiles and other configuration files for my Arch Linux system on my ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 6. I have a separate repository for my Vim configuration.

## Installation
Run the setup script. Sudo may be needed to create some of the symlinks. WARNING: old config files will be overwritten by the script as of now, however the script will ask for confirmation before creating the symlinks.

As an option, the script can pull my Vim config as a submodule and install that too.
